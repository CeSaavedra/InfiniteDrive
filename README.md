# Infinite Drive

## Project Description

This project is a 3D web-based driving simulator game that allows you to drive on an endless, four-laned highway. As you cruise, the game displays a visually pleasing urban environment with dynamic city lights. The player controls their designated car with the ability to turn, accelerate, and decelerate. The objective is simply to enjoy an infinite driving experience as the road and game environment continue endlessly.

## Completed Implementations (as of 4/30)

- **3D Model of Player’s Car (Unpolished)**
- **Continuous Road & Environment Generation:**  
  The game generates a continuous road and a flowing environment.
- **Headlights & Functional Taillights:**  
  Dynamic lighting integrated into the player’s car.
- **Gravity & Ground Collision Detection:**  
  Physics-based gravity and collision detection ensure the car stays on the road.
- **Acceleration & Deceleration Controls**
- **Left-to-Right Turning Mechanics (Unpolished)**
- **Tire Rotation Based on Speed:**  
  The tires visually rotate in accordance with the player’s speed.

## To-Do / Timeline

### May 1st
- Implement glow/light effects on building windows.
- Add collision detection for road barriers.
- Implement 3D highway barriers and roadside buildings.

### May 4th
- Create an NPC 3D car model.
- Apply textures and finalize the 3D player car model.
- Create a HUD to display miles per hour.

### May 7th
- Define NPC car behavior and physics.
- Randomize colors for NPC cars.
- Enhance the HUD to include distance traveled.

### May 12th
- Add tire particle effects and possibly exhaust particle effects.
- Polish driving controls.

## Possible Inclusions
- Implement driving sounds.
- Improve street light performance (currently challenging).
- Establish an end game mode with high score tracking for distance traveled without a crash.
