# Infinite Drive

## Project Description

This project is a 3D web-based driving simulator game that allows you to drive on an endless, four-laned highway. As you cruise, the game displays a visually pleasing urban environment with dynamic city lights. The player controls their designated car with the ability to turn, accelerate, and decelerate. The objective is simply to enjoy an infinite driving experience as the road and game environment continue endlessly.

## Completed Implementations as of 4/30

- 3D Model of Player’s Car (Unpolished)
- Created continuous road and continuously generated environment
- Headlights and functional taillights
- Implemented gravity and ground collision detection
- Acceleration and Deceleration Controls
- Left-to-Right Turning Mechanics (Unpolished)
- Tires rotate corresponding to the player’s speed

## To-Do / Timeline

### May 1st
- Implement glow/light effects to building windows
- Add collision to road barrier
- Implement 3D highway barriers and buildings along the roadside

### May 4th
- Create NPC 3D car model
- Apply texture to and finalize the 3D player car model
- Create a HUD – Add UI to display miles per hour

### May 7th
- Define NPC car behavior and physics
- Randomize colors of NPC cars  
- HUD – Add distance traveled

### May 12th
- Add tire particle effects + Possibly exhaust particle effects
- Polish driving controls

## Possible Inclusions

- Implement driving sounds
- Implement Street Lights – Challenging due to performance issues
- Establish end game – Record player high score for distance traveled without crash
