# Infinite Drive

## Project Description

This project is a 3D web-based driving simulator game that allows you to drive on an endless, four-laned highway. As you cruise, the game displays a visually pleasing urban environment with dynamic city lights. The player controls their designated car with the ability to turn, accelerate, and decelerate. The objective is simply to enjoy an infinite driving experience as the road and game environment continue endlessly. The majority of this project was created in the span of 29 days.
